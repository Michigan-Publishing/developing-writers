Let’s hear more from Ryan McCarty as he talks about how teachers do this work in the classroom.  \\n\\nFirst of all, we can help students to talk about the connections they are making, and thus make those connections consciously.\\n\\nAnd second, pointing out the tools that are used by specific disciplines, especially as students are actually using them in their writing, is important.
