(Sorry, no audio file available.) \n\nListening to our classmates or colleagues is an altogether different experience. Sometimes, we turn to trusted friends because we know that they can help us with specific writing skills. But, we can turn to our friends for another reason: because they can help us understand how an audience reads our work. Feedback of this sort often has more to do with writing issues like tone and mood, rather than the questions of structure or grammar that writing instructors help us with.\n\nConsider people in the community, or at work, or at school who can help too. At school there may also be a writing center that offers resources and support for students to come in and get feedback on their work. Remember that friends are a valuable source of feedback as well, especially if they’re the target audience. <INTERNAL LINK to audience content page.>","title":"What is self-sponsored feedback?"},{"point":"Writers look to different kinds of people for feedback. But as you’ll learn in the other sections, it’s not where or with whom you receive feedback, it’s how you use it. Writers engage with feedback effectively when they think about a larger purpose for their writing and the various audiences outside the classroom, as well as think through their own writing and make informed decisions about their revisions. Whether writers receive feedback from teachers, authority figures, or peers, they can use feedback in more thoughtful ways.

A couple of options:\n* Option #1: One version of the live poll could ask users to choose from a list of possible people with which they participate in feedback (e.g. with close friends, with managers, with co-workers, with family members), or writing situations for which they feel feedback is necessary (e.g., personal writing, work writing). When users submit their votes, they will be able to see the percentages for all votes.\n* Option #2: Another version of the live poll could ask users to answer a simple question (e.g., “Who gives you feedback?”). The poll results, then, would keep track of the top 10 results at all times, which means that users would have a somewhat new experience every time they visited this part of the page.","title":"Do you feedback?"},{"point":"We recently asked people about popular conceptions of writing.
