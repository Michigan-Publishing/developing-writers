In fact, most of us are doing it all the time: when we text, when we share photos or videos, when we ❤️ somebody else’s photos or videos. \n\nBut ❤️ isn’t always effective. Usually it doesn’t work in a résumé, a business letter, or a research paper.

First, who is the audience and what is the composing situation? For instance, a photograph of you and your friends at the pool might seem out of place when writing to a prospective employer, but might be perfect for your followers on Instagram.\n\nSometimes the situation isn’t so clear.
