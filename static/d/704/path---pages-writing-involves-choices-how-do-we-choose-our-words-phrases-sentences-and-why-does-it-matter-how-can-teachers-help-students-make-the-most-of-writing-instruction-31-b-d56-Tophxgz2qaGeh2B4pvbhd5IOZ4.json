[link to Ryan’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.39)\n* However, as author Ryan McCarty points out, students often want to draw on a wider range of writing tools and practices in order to reach their chosen audience. They see writing development:\n  * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [link to Ryan’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.40)\n  * “as a process of learning many genres and practices from a range of disciplines, professions, and extracurricular contexts, often holding these practices up for comparison, with the goal of leveraging all of those knowledges against each other to be more effective across all of the contexts in which they write” (116)\n  * To hear more about how students draw from different parts of their educational become writers, from the author, click here.

As Kris says, while integrating lessons from physics and philosophy into her own work in biology: she needs to “look at different ways to read and write.” INTERNAL LINK to [Option 2, Main Point 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-1UlV002Iq3f9ulzUwiGQS6m15NDMccAevCZskx-0o/edit#bookmark=id.5odg6jetrbk3)\n* And Jonah helps us see that the tools that we learn to use in academic writing can be used in non-academic settings.

Let’s hear more from Ryan McCarty as he talks about how teachers do this work in the classroom.  \n  * First of all, we can help students to talk about the connections they are making, and thus make those connections consciously.\n  * ARTIFACT REQUEST: Link to Ryan’s interview (and transcript?), [MVI_5287](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19w0ujeboz4RmdUdwdm9ZrZLfzkbndXSi/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1537129924049000), 0:48-1:20\n  * And second, pointing out the tools that are used by specific disciplines, especially as students are actually using them in their writing, is important.
