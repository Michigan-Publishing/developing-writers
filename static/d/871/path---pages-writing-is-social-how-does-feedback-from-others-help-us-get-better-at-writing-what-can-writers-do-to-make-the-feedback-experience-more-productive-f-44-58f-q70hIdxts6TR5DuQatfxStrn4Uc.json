But simply accepting all suggestions is no more helpful than rejecting all of them.\n- We should always be asking ourselves, how can this suggestion help me reach my goals?

To sort through the responses, imagine a graph:\n\n\n![Accepting feedback diagram](/assets/feedback_quadrants.png)\n\nEach quadrant of this graph represents a different response that writers might have to feedback from either experts or peers. Let’s look at what each quadrant represents\n\n* **Uncritical Acceptance**: adopts all of the suggestions that are made without question\n  * Example: A student receives feedback from her teacher on a paper, and incorporates all the suggestions into her work on the grounds that this will get her the best possible grade.\n* **Uncritical Resistance**: reject without question all of the suggestions \n  * Example: A student refuses to even look at the feedback on her paper because she feels the instructor has been rude to her or is just wrong.\n* **Critical Acceptance**: adopt specific suggestions because they help us connect with our goals\n  * Example: Feedback from an instructor causes a student to wonder how she can make a key point in her paper clearer to her audience.\n* **Critical Resistance**: decline specific suggestions because they do not address our writerly goals\n  * Example: A student receives feedback from her instructor, but chooses not to adopt the feedback because it doesn’t help fulfill her own vision for the assignment.","title":"How do we know if we are critically engaged?"}]}},"childPages":null,"siblingPages":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-is-social/how-does-feedback-from-others-help-us-get-better-at-writing/what-can-feedback-do/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What can feedback do?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-is-social/how-does-feedback-from-others-help-us-get-better-at-writing/what-is-feedback/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is feedback?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-is-social/how-does-feedback-from-others-help-us-get-better-at-writing/how-does-feedback-work-and-how-does-it-work-well/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How does feedback work and how does it work well?"}}}]},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Writing Involves Choices","key":"writing-involves-choices","parentKey":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter/how-do-phrases-and-sentences-create-a-reader-experience/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do phrases and sentences create a reader experience?","key":"how-do-phrases-and-sentences-create-a-reader-experience","parentKey":"how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do we choose our words—phrases—sentences?
