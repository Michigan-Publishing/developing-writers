So, yeah, there hasn't really been that much writing necessarily, that's gone into that class, it's more just been—well actually, we're one of the first groups to go. The presentations span over like the course of a month, and we're the first day, so we haven't had that much time to prepare, but it's been really interesting and I think that the Prezi definitely is going to add something… \n  * We had this one map that we're showing and then we want to show another map next to it and, rather than clicking on the next slide, we just zoom out, and you can see both maps next to each other.
