Developing Writers in Higher Education: A Longitudinal Study follows 169 undergraduates across four years to show how they become more effective writers. \n\nIf you are a student …\n\nIf you are a specialist in writing studies … \n\nIf you are a policy maker or administrator …\n\nIf you are a writing teacher … \n\nIf you are a person who writes … \n\nthis book is for you.\n\n[This video](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.323) explains the genesis of the project and how it took shape. The authors also explain how they developed the central questions of their chapters. \n\nIn their videos, Anne Gere and Naomi Silver discuss the complex and surprising ways that students develop as writers, as well as the impact that a college education makes on writing. To view their videos: [for students and other writers](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.325); [for instructors](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.326); for [policy makers and administrators](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.324). \n\n## What is this project?\n\nDeveloping Writers in Higher Education: A Longitudinal Study represents the outcome of a research project led by the Gayle Morris Sweetland Center for Writing at the University of Michigan. The project  investigates how college students develop as writers across their undergraduate years. \n\nThe publication of the project consists of three layers: an interactive “engagement layer” that connects the findings of the project to the everyday importance of writing; a “reading layer” that presents the text of the scholarly book (Developing Writers in Higher Education: A Longitudinal Study, published by the University of Michigan Press, <https://dx.doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890>); and a “data layer” that provides interviews, surveys, and samples of student writing, including eportfolios, to display the many different ways these students become effective writers. \n\nThe preparation of this multi-layered publication was enabled by a generous grant from the “Book Unbound” project of the University of Michigan’s Humanities Collaboratory, a multi-disciplinary, multi-generational investigation into potential future forms of book-length publication that involved faculty members, students, and staff from classics, film studies, and writing studies, as well as partners from the School of Information, the Library, and the Press at University of Michigan.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis publication was generously funded from 2017-2019 by the [University of Michigan’s Humanities Collaboratory](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/collaboratory/). The “engagement layer” was created by a collaborative team listed below. The online project is hosted primarily on [Fulcrum, a multimedia-rich publishing platform](https://www.fulcrum.org/) created at University of Michigan Library with support from the Andrew W.
