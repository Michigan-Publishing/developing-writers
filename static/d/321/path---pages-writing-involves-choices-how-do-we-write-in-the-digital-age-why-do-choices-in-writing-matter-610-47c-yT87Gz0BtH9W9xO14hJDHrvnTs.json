When writers make choices to include other modes in their compositions, they are considering different ways that they might reach different readers—after all, good writing reaches as many readers as possible.","title":"Because sometimes writers need different ways of reaching their readers."},{"point":"Text may be enough to get a message across to readers, but other resources to help readers better understand specific points. When writers make choices to include features like tables and images, they consider what parts of their writing might benefit from different or additional representations.

Check out what Kaitlin says about it:  ARTIFACT REQUEST [Naomi’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.21): “Comparing traditional writing and new media writing is to me the difference between a printed set of papers and a piece that lives on the web. What made me start to accept new media was its gift of using hyperlinks to forever banish the  bibliography to the seventh circle of literary hell. Even better, hyperlinks give you the power to seamlessly provide research and evidence for a point with nothing more than the click of a mouse. With new media you also suddenly have the ability to illustrate writing with pictures and graphics that there previously was never room for. And with new media, pieces truly do live. On the web, you don’t just publish something; rather you have the capability to keep going back and editing what you’ve already put out there” (238).","title":"Because we can!"}]}},"childPages":null,"siblingPages":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-write-in-the-digital-age/when-would-writers-use-multimodal-composition/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"When would writers use multimodal composition?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-write-in-the-digital-age/how-do-writers-compose-in-the-digital-age/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do writers compose in the digital age?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-write-in-the-digital-age/what-is-multimodal-composition-and-where-do-people-encounter-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is Multimodal Composition and Where Do People Encounter It?"}}}]},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Writing Involves Choices","key":"writing-involves-choices","parentKey":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter/how-do-phrases-and-sentences-create-a-reader-experience/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do phrases and sentences create a reader experience?","key":"how-do-phrases-and-sentences-create-a-reader-experience","parentKey":"how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-write-in-the-digital-age/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do we write in the digital age?","key":"how-do-we-write-in-the-digital-age","parentKey":"writing-involves-choices"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter/how-can-teachers-help-students-make-the-most-of-writing-instruction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How can teachers help students make the most of writing instruction?","key":"how-can-teachers-help-students-make-the-most-of-writing-instruction","parentKey":"how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-choose-our-words-phrases-sentences-and-why-does-it-matter/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How do we choose our words—phrases—sentences?
