Three questions that often elicit generative feedback are: What’s\n      working for you in the writing? Why is it working? What are moments where\n      you’re confused or have questions?\n\n\n      [This lesson plan](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.286) from Ben\n      (chapter 2) can help teachers and students learn about and engage with\n      peer review.\n\n\n      [This lesson plan](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.285) from Ben\n      (chapter 2) provides directions for in-class face-to-face peer review.\n\n\n      Easing into Peer Review in your class\n\n\n      If you sense that students don’t feel authorized to give each other\n      feedback, have them play the “what if” game. After reading a classmate’s\n      essay they ask what would happen if …? For example, what if you changed\n      the title? What if you moved this sentence to the beginning of the\n      paragraph instead of the end?\n\n\n      Another activity to help get students into peer review is the eliminate\n      100 game: ask students to eliminate 100 words from their own or a\n      classmate’s writing.\n\n\n      To help students engage with the purpose of peer review, try this reading\n      to explain a goal of writing workshop: [Jeremiah Chamberlain’s “Workshop\n      is not for\n      you”](http://www.glimmertrain.com/bulletins/essays/b27chamberlin.php)\n\n\n      For more information about peer review and feedback, check out [Using Peer\n      Review to Improve Student\n      Writing.](https://lsa.umich.edu/sweetland/instructors/teaching-resources/using-peer-review-to-improve-student-writing.html)\n    title: >-\n      What type of feedback works?

Three questions that often elicit generative feedback are: What’s working for you in the writing? Why is it working? What are moments where you’re confused or have questions?\n\n[This lesson plan](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.286) from Ben (chapter 2) can help teachers and students learn about and engage with peer review.\n\n[This lesson plan](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.285) from Ben (chapter 2) provides directions for in-class face-to-face peer review.\n\nEasing into Peer Review in your class\n\nIf you sense that students don’t feel authorized to give each other feedback, have them play the “what if” game. After reading a classmate’s essay they ask what would happen if …? For example, what if you changed the title? What if you moved this sentence to the beginning of the paragraph instead of the end?\n\nAnother activity to help get students into peer review is the eliminate 100 game: ask students to eliminate 100 words from their own or a classmate’s writing.\n\nTo help students engage with the purpose of peer review, try this reading to explain a goal of writing workshop: [Jeremiah Chamberlain’s “Workshop is not for you”](http://www.glimmertrain.com/bulletins/essays/b27chamberlin.php)\n\nFor more information about peer review and feedback, check out [Using Peer Review to Improve Student Writing.](https://lsa.umich.edu/sweetland/instructors/teaching-resources/using-peer-review-to-improve-student-writing.html)","title":"What type of feedback works?
