Respondents indicated that they participate in feedback with a variety of people, mostly INFOGRAPHIC: a word cloud that indicates with whom.\n\nFeedback works well when we have the opportunity to receive it from people who we believe are authorized to give it to us. In school, this is most often from our instructors. Sometimes we are asked to give and receive feedback from peers. And sometimes we seek it out on our own. Sometimes we hesitate to seek feedback from our peers, but they can be the exact audience we’re targeting.

I think he did a good job structuring the peer editing sessions where they were constructive and they weren’t everyone was saying, “Oh, great job.” You got honest feedback, but it was a safe space where people were also telling you what they liked, and you felt okay bringing big ideas to the table. I wrote about struggling with depression, which I was just—that’s something that I don’t talk about with anyone, but I was impressed that \\[instructor] was able to make a space that I felt comfortable doing that with 20 strangers.”",title:"From whom do we solicit feedback?"},{point:"It’s not necessarily about where we get feedback, but what we do with the feedback we receive.

Are they doing everything we recommend, nothing at all, or something in between? Encourage students to critically analyze feedback the way they analyze other texts to figure out what works best for their writing.\n* VIDEO INTERVIEW with Emily and Justine discussing the pedagogical implications of their chapter\n* VIDEO INTERVIEW: with Ben to have him explain how peer review improves student writing.\n\n## FOR INSTRUCTORS: peer review\n\n* Consider having students peer review each other’s work at different stages in the writing process, having them write to each other about what’s working (and why) and what’s confusing (and why). Allow students to talk out with each other how their work is going. This lesson plan may also help teach students more about peer review and how to make it work for them: REQUEST FOR AUTHORS: lesson plan on how to teach students how to peer review—can this include how to teach students to respect each others’ voices?\n* Easing into Peer Review in your class\n  * If you sense that students don’t feel authorized to give each other feedback, have them play the “what if” game. After reading a classmate’s essay they ask what would happen if …? For example, what if you changed the title? What if you moved this sentence to the beginning of the paragraph instead of the end?\n  * Another activity to help get students into peer review is the eliminate 100 game: ask students to eliminate 100 words from their own or a classmate’s writing. \n* Make sure students are aware of the purpose of peer review as well. ARTIFACT REQUEST: I think this is from Ben’s chapter (page numbers are updated to reflect the most recent copy): [Link to Ben’s chapter:](https://umich.box.com/s/wwvk6ktnxdwux6fw98jede9ygwjjsrgg) “A clear finding, then, is that when students report that the purpose of peer review is unclear to them, they are likely to fall back on dominant ideologies not only around grammatical correctness, but also, as I argue, around a transactional view of writing expertise that privileges instructor authority over student authority, undermining the stated goals of peer review” (8-9). Peer review is most effective when students know the purpose and have clear goals, like specific questions to respond to in their peer’s writing. Three questions that often elicit generative feedback are: What’s working for you in what I’ve writing? Why is it working? What are moments where you’re confused or have questions?\n* To help students engage with the purpose of peer review, try this reading to explain a goal of writing workshop: EXTERNAL LINK: to [Jeremiah Chamberlain’s “Workshop is not for you”](http://www.glimmertrain.com/bulletins/essays/b27chamberlin.php)",title:"What type of feedback works?
