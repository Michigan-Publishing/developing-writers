      * Words are the ground level of writing. In all writing, certain words
      communicate confidence, carefulness, and consideration. So how do writers
      choose these words to build our meanings from the ground up?

      * Let’s play around with a few words to see how they build meaning into
      our phrases and sentences.

      * USER ACTIVITY: The Toolbox, Part 1. [Link to Toolbox
      concept.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LsPCXM5s0-VYdMLf9FGC7b9eq2ONpgeI/view)
      Users will be taken to a screen with two boxes that contain the following
      questions:
        * Which words express confidence?
        * Which words express caution and consideration?
      * When users click on a question box, they will be taken to a sample
      sentence with blank spaces. Scattered over the page will be word blocks;
      when users drag one of the word blocks into the sentence, a text box will
      pop up offering an explanation of how the word affects the sentence.
        * Which words express confidence? Users will read a short sentence and then drag one of the word blocks from above into the empty space. Once they do, a short explanation will pop up, telling them the effect that their word has on the sentence, along with an option to read more about it in the book. At the bottom of the screen, users have the option to return to the Toolbox, read more of the student’s work (from which the sample comes), or move on to the next section.
        * Sentence #1: Let’s look at some writing from Abby, a chemistry major. Try moving some of the text blocks into the sentence below to see how they change her writing:
        * “The next peak occurs at 6.7 and corresponds to the multiplet that has an area of three so it \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ correspond to Group C and E. (Scientific report by Abby, chemistry major)” ([Link to Laura’s chapter 152](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.51)).
        * Word Options
          * Must (152): “indicates certainty in a statement that demonstrates knowledge: must intensifies a discipline-specific statement about correspondence between the noted peak and the groups in the study.” In other words, because of the number, Abby is very certain that it connects to Groups C and E.

          * Perhaps (146): “indicate\[s] qualified or cautious certainty” about the peak’s correspondence to Group C and E. [Click here to learn more.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.45)
          * Absolutely: expresses complete certainty about the correspondence between the peak and Groups C and E. [Click here to learn more.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.44)
          * Possibly: expresses some certainty about the correspondence between the peak and Groups C and E. [Click here to learn more.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.44)
        * Which words express caution and consideration? The idea here is the same: pull a word block into the empty space of a sample sentence and read what effect the word has. At the bottom of the screen, users have the option to return to the Toolbox, read more of the student’s work, or move on to the next section.
        * Sentence #2: Let’s look at some writing from Ayanna, a business major. Try moving the text blocks into the sentence below to see how they change the writing:
        * “Anyway, the very words that humans created can be insufficient to describe this meaning. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can be described with words. (Reflective essay by Ayanna, business major)” (150)
        * Word Options
          * Some things: leaves the possibility open that other things cannot be described with words. [Click here to learn more.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.44)
          * Not everything: (150): This phrase “shows the use of a qualified generalization that explicitly counters a potential generalization.” In other words, Ayanna indicates that words cannot account for every single meaning. [Click here to learn more.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.49)
          * Things: assumes most, if not all, things can be described with words. [Click here to learn more.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.44)
      * As you can see, these words have different effects on phrases and
      sentences. Let’s learn more about these words in the next section.
    title: How do words communicate?
  - point: >-
      * Words like “everyone” and “society” can be applied to a wide range of
      things, people, and ideas. They encourage readers to think in very general
      terms, or in generalities. 
        * In this example, writer Sarah Zhang shows how a study applies broadly to people’s perception of race.
          * “A 2014 study found that when people read a newspaper article about genetic-ancestry tests, their beliefs in racial differences increased.”

        * In this example from the book, Shannon shows how widespread the effect of teaching is on children and society.
          * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [Link to Laura’s chapter.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.47) [Link to Shannon’s DSP.](https://umich.box.com/s/a84mklxotpvb49nm5gjafkiaamborbwb)
          * “The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow, so if we do not put great significance on the way in which teachers are chosen, children will be deprived of an effective education and won’t be able to handle society’s money” (149).
      * Words like “people” or “society” can be qualified with other words to
      soften or limit the range of application. Qualified generalities show
      readers that claims may not apply to everyone or everything—which invites
      other interpretations and possibilities.
        * In this example, Bill and Melinda Gates use qualified generalities to show a difference in people’s perceptions of poverty.
          * “Primed by depressing and shocking headlines, most people assume that poverty has increased. Some people say it has held steady.”

        * In this example from the book, Amanda uses a qualified generality to show that while Milton’s references tend to have “other underlying messages,” there are other contexts in which they may not.
          * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [Link to Laura’s chapter.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.50) [Link to Amanda’s research paper.](https://umich.app.box.com/file/313619967561)
          * “His references almost always have other underlying messages that a typical scholar of today must search for more deeply, but at the time were usually well known within the intellectual sphere. Images involving religion or classical mythology do not necessarily agree in today’s world, but they worked well for Milton to address multiple perspectives that his audience could comprehend no matter what they believed in” (152).
    title: What are generalities?
  - point: >-
      * Certainties are words that show readers how much confidence writers have
      in their claims. Writers who are confident about their claims and want to
      state them as generalities use boosters. Writers who are somewhat
      confident about their claims and want to leave room for other views use
      hedges.

      * Boosters are words that express complete certainty about claims. They
      require care in use, because while they give writing confidence, they can
      leave little to no room for others’ views. Examples of boosters include
      “clearly,” “definitely,” and “without a doubt.”
        * In this example, writer Melina Delcik uses a booster to express certainty about the value of a news story.
          * “It was, without a doubt, the kind of breaking news The Times considers important to delve into quickly and thoroughly”

        * In this example from the book, Owen uses a booster to expresses confidence about how to improve teaching in the United States.
          * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [Link to Laura’s chapter.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.48) [Link to Owen’s DSP.](https://umich.box.com/s/pe7vvyff75o9876do3zkandhxubr85eq)
          * “This method would undeniably improve America’s educational system by replacing the bottom six to ten percent of public-school teachers that currently hinder it” (149).
      * Hedges are words that express caution about our certainty. While hedges
      may sometimes give an impression of uncertainty, they can also open space
      for others’ views and interpretations. Examples of hedges include
      “perhaps,” “might,” and “possibly.”
        * In this example, author Nicholas Carr uses a hedge to express the possibility that critics who think the Internet is ruining us are right.
          * “Perhaps those who dismiss critics of the Internet as Luddites or nostalgists will be proved correct, and from our hyperactive, data-stoked minds will spring a golden age of intellectual discovery and universal wisdom.”

        * In this example from the book, the student uses a hedge to express doubt about Adam’s ability to achieve autonomy in the same way as other children.
          * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [Link to Laura’s chapter. ](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.46)
          * “Since Adam is suffering from FAS which will affect his life in every domain in significant ways, it will be unlikely that he will be able to achieve or will be expected by others to achieve autonomy as much as other children” (146-47).

      What kinds of words do writers use to express generalities and qualified
      certainties?
afterPoints: >-
  **Main Takeaways:** Words can have an effect on whether readers believe
  writers’ claims. Using boosters that express generalities can be convincing in
  some cases, but using hedges that express qualified generalities conveys more
  considerations for others’ perspectives and interpretations.
