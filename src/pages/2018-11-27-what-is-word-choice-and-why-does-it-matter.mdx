      Words are the ground level of writing. In all writing, certain words
      communicate confidence, carefulness, and consideration. So how do writers
      choose these words to build our meanings from the ground up?


      Let’s play around with a few words to see how they build meaning into our
      phrases and sentences.


      As you can see, these words have different effects on phrases and
      sentences. Let’s learn more about these words in the next section.
    title: How do words communicate?
  - point: >-
      Words like “everyone” and “society” can be applied to a wide range of
      things, people, and ideas. They encourage readers to think in very general
      terms, or in generalities.


      In this example, writer Sarah Zhang shows how a study applies broadly to
      people’s perception of race.


      > [A 2014 study found that when people read a newspaper article about
      genetic-ancestry tests, their beliefs in racial differences
      increased.](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/09/your-dna-is-not-your-culture/571150/)


      In this example from the book, Shannon shows how widespread the effect of
      teaching is on children and society.


      > [The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow, so if we do not put
      great significance on the way in which teachers are chosen, children will
      be deprived of an effective education and won’t be able to handle
      society’s money](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.47)


      Words like “people” or “society” can be qualified with other words to
      soften or limit the range of application. Qualified generalities show
      readers that claims may not apply to everyone or everything—which invites
      other interpretations and possibilities.


      In this example, Bill and Melinda Gates use qualified generalities to show
      a difference in people’s perceptions of poverty.


      > [Primed by depressing and shocking headlines, most people assume that
      poverty has increased. Some people say it has held
      steady.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/22/opinion/sunday/bill-gates-melinda-gates-global-poverty.html)


      In this example from the book, Amanda uses a qualified generality to show
      that while Milton’s references tend to have “other underlying messages,”
      these other messages may not be obvious to today’s readers.

    title: What are generalities?
  - point: >-
      Certainties are words that show readers how much confidence writers have
      in their claims. Writers who are confident about their claims and want to
      state them as generalities use boosters. Writers who are somewhat
      confident about their claims and want to leave room for other views use
      hedges.


      Boosters are words that express complete certainty about claims. They
      require care in use, because while they give writing confidence, they can
      leave little to no room for others’ views. Examples of boosters include
      “clearly,” “definitely,” and “without a doubt.”


      In this example, writer Melina Delcik uses a booster to express certainty
      about the value of a news story.


      > [It was, without a doubt, the kind of breaking news The Times considers
      important to delve into quickly and
      thoroughly](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/insider/embargoes-reporting.html)


      In this example from the book, Owen uses a booster to expresses confidence
      about how to improve teaching in the United States.


      > [This method would undeniably improve America’s educational system by
      replacing the bottom six to ten percent of public-school teachers that
      currently hinder it.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.48)


      Hedges are words that express caution about our certainty. While hedges
      may sometimes give an impression of uncertainty, they can also open space
      for others’ views and interpretations. Examples of hedges include
      “perhaps,” “might,” and “possibly.”


      In this example, author Nicholas Carr uses a hedge to express the
      possibility that critics who think the Internet is ruining us are right.


      > [Perhaps those who dismiss critics of the Internet as Luddites or
      nostalgists will be proved correct, and from our hyperactive, data-stoked
      minds will spring a golden age of intellectual discovery and universal
      wisdom.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/)


      In this example from the book, the student uses a hedge to express doubt
      about Adam’s ability to achieve autonomy in the same way as other
      children.


      > [Since Adam is suffering from FAS which will affect his life in every
      domain in significant ways, it will be unlikely that he will be able to
      achieve or will be expected by others to achieve autonomy as much as other
      children.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.46)

      What kinds of words do writers use to express generalities and qualified
      certainties?
afterPoints: >-
  Words can have an effect on whether readers believe writers’ claims. Using
  boosters that express generalities can be convincing in some cases, but using
  hedges that express qualified generalities conveys more considerations for
  others’ perspectives and interpretations.
