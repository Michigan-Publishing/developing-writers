      * The reader experience consists of what the reader notices when engaging
      with a piece of writing, and so phrases and sentences direct the reader’s
      attention.

      * USER ACTIVITY: Toolbox, Part 2. [Link to Toolbox
      concept.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LsPCXM5s0-VYdMLf9FGC7b9eq2ONpgeI/view)
      Users will be taken to a screen with two boxes that contain the following
      questions:
        * How do phrases position writers?
        * How do phrases affect readers?
      * When users click on a question box, they will be taken to a sample
      sentence with underlined portions. Users hover over underlined portions of
      a sample sentence, and then a box will pop up with information about what
      a particular phrase does to the meaning. 
        * How do phrases position writers? Users hover over underlined portions of a sample sentence (in this case, from a student interview) to read about what a particular phrase does to the meaning. The bottom navigation is the same; however, users can access the interview transcript and/or audio if they want to know more.
        * Sentence #1: Let’s look at an interview from Kaitlin, an English and communication studies major. Hover over the underlined part of the sentence to read more about how Kaitlin establishes voice:
        * “It was something that I really cared about and \[my instructor] helped me find Bitch Magazine and so that helped me write it in that voice where it was just…” (Link to Zak’s chapter 174).
        * **Hover Option**
          * that voice (174): “Here, Kaitlin’s pronoun shifts from ‘my voice’ to ‘that voice,’ suggesting that there are multiple voices from which to choose.” [Click here to learn more.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.54)
        * How do phrases affect readers? Users will hover over the underlined portions of the sentence to read more about what a particular phrase does to the meaning. Users can access the student writing sample if they want to know more” 
        * Sentence #2: Let’s look at some writing from Jon, an English major. Hover over the underlined parts of the sentence to read more about Jon’s use of style in his paper:
        * “This comparison may seem, at first glance perfectly valid, and perhaps even convincing; after all, both Satan and those involved with the rising of 1381 were rebels acting out against the pugnant estate and God, respectively” ([Link to Zak’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.55) 181).
        * **Hover Option**
          * `May seem, at first glance` (181): These phrases are not Jon’s individual voice, but rather a “recurring rhetorical \[device] closely associated with the field and genre Jon is participating in, an interpretative argument about English literature.” In other words, readers can see that Jon is using a phrase of his discipline.

      * The reader experience a writer produces relates to the audience and
      genre they are writing for and within.

      * Writers often construct phrases and sentences that help them communicate
      in specific ways for particular political, religious, or academic
      communities. Common ways of phrasing or constructing sentences reveal some
      of the rules that govern a community’s communication practices. For
      example, check out the phrases and sentences Kris constructs in her
      biology honors thesis.

        * “While ccrM expression is itself tightly controlled by CtrA, the master cell cycle regulator, it regulates many cell cycle genes via methylation status of various promoters, including ctrA and genes encoding cell division proteins, polarity determining proteins, proteins involved in cell shape, division, and DNA replication \[21]. C. crescentus CcrM homologs have been identified in at least 20 other α-proteobacteria \[38] and are essential in A. tumefaciens \[39], S. meliloti \[40], and B. abortus \[41]” (120).
        * The phrases that have been bolded are examples of Kris’ use of language specific to her community. A little later in the chapter, she explains how she came to an understanding of the way her community of scientists communicates.

        * “At first when I was starting to read papers, I thought scientists used unnecessarily large words to describe things. Then what I found as I started writing was that we have a specific vocabulary, just like any field does, and it’s just way easier to communicate in that way. You can use one word to describe what would have to be used as a whole sentence” (120).
