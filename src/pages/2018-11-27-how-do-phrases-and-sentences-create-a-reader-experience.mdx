      The reader experience consists of what the reader notices when engaging
      with a piece of writing, and so phrases and sentences direct the reader’s
      attention.


      The reader experience a writer produces relates to the audience and genre
      they are writing for and within.

      To learn more about what it means to write for an audience, check out our
      Audiences and Expectations page
      [here](/pages/writing-is-social/how-is-writing-a-social-activity/what-does-it-mean-to-write-for-an-audience/).


      Writers often construct phrases and sentences that help them communicate
      in specific ways for particular political, religious, or academic
      communities. Common ways of phrasing or constructing sentences reveal some
      of the rules that govern a community’s communication practices. For
      example, check out the phrases and sentences Kris constructs in her
      biology honors thesis.


      > [While ccrM expression is itself tightly controlled by CtrA, the master
      cell cycle regulator, it regulates many cell cycle genes via **methylation
      status of various promoters**, including ctrA and **genes encoding cell
      division proteins, polarity determining proteins, proteins involved in
      cell shape, division, and DNA replication**

      The phrases that have been bolded are examples of Kris’ use of language
      specific to her community. A little later in the chapter, she explains how
      she came to an understanding of the way her community of scientists
      communicates.

      audiences and their expectations?

  Building words into particular phrases and sentences guides how a reader will
  consider a writer’s work.

In our study, we learned that words construct phrases and sentences, which, in turn, guides what the reader will feel and think.
