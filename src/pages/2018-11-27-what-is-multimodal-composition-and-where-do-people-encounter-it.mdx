      Take a look at the objects below. Which of these objects counts as
      composition? Click all that apply.


      * On one screen, users will select whichever objects they believe count as
      composition (e.g., essay, newspaper, text message, emojis, meme,
      photograph, diagram, video). When they make their selections, the objects
      will be shadowed and have bright green check marks over them. Users will
      then click “Next” to move to the next section of the activity.

      * Possible examples for the website (I think we should have a mix of
      materials we already have and some external ones—we should discuss):

    title: What Counts as Multimodal Composition?
  - point: >-
      * These are ALL multimodal composition. Hover your mouse over the items
      below to read more about different kinds of multimodal writing and where
      you might encounter them. The same objects from the previous screen will
      show up, with a small green check mark in the upper right corner for the
      ones the user has selected. When a user hovers their mouse over all of
      these items, speech bubbles (which will be adaptive to where they are on
      the screen) with brief explanations will pop up. The items, once again,
      are as follows:

      * Photographs/Images: Alone or with text, images make compelling
      statements. 

      * Text Messages: Text messages are a form of multimodal composing that
      because includes elements such as images and emojis to enhance the meaning
      of speech bubbles.

      * Emojis: A Japanese term that translates as “picture character,” the
      emoji conveys emotions effectively

      large number of readers.

      voice, and music.

      Abby was skeptical about multimodal composition because it didn’t seem
      like “real” writing to her. Click to
      [read](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.282) and [listen
      to](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.279) Abby’s perspective.


      Jenna, on the other hand, learned that multimodal composition provides
      many options for expressing meaning. Click here to

      As you may have already noticed, this website uses text, image, audio,
      video, and graphics to attract readers and keep them engaged.
    title: Even This Website Is Multimodal
afterPoints: >-
  Multimodal composition uses multiple resources for expression.


  Multimodal composition communicates meaning in ways that text-based writing
  cannot.


  Multimodal composition includes a range of choices, including image, video,
  audio,and digital tools.
---
In our study, we learned that multimodal composition includes image, video, audio, and digital tools. Writers choose among these resources to best convey their meaning to their audience.
