      Take a look at the objects below. Which of these objects counts as
      composition? Click all that apply.


      * On one screen, users will select whichever objects they believe count as
      composition (e.g., essay, newspaper, text message, emojis, meme,
      photograph, diagram, video). When they make their selections, the objects
      will be shadowed and have bright green check marks over them. Users will
      then click “Next” to move to the next section of the activity.

      * Possible examples for the website (I think we should have a mix of
      materials we already have and some external ones—we should discuss):

    title: What Counts as Multimodal Composition?
  - point: >-
      * These are ALL multimodal composition. Hover your mouse over the items
      below to read more about different kinds of multimodal writing and where
      you might encounter them. The same objects from the previous screen will
      show up, with a small green check mark in the upper right corner for the
      ones the user has selected. When a user hovers their mouse over all of
      these items, speech bubbles (which will be adaptive to where they are on
      the screen) with brief explanations will pop up. The items, once again,
      are as follows:

      * Photographs/Images: Alone or with text, images make compelling
      statements. 

      * Text Messages: Text messages are a form of multimodal composing that
      because includes elements such as images and emojis to enhance the meaning
      of speech bubbles.

      * Emojis: A Japanese term that translates as “picture character,” the
      emoji conveys emotions effectively 
        * EXTERNAL LINK: [Link to Emoji Tracker](http://emojitracker.com/), which shows real time numbers for emoji use on Twitter (with a warning for epilepsy). Perhaps there is a better, more accessible example for users to play around with?
      * Memes: Memes are a simple way of taking a big idea and sharing it with a
      large number of readers. 
        * EXTERNAL LINK: [Link to Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/), which provides information and histories for emerging and long-standing memes on the Internet.
      * Diagrams/Figures: Diagrams and figures can make dense or statistical
      information more digestible and approachable for our readers. 
        * EXTERNAL LINK: [Link to The Data Visualization Catalog](https://datavizcatalogue.com/), which shows different kinds of visualizations used to represent data.
      * Video: Video can also help readers understand and experience meaning in
      more dynamic terms. 

      * Audio: Audio can enhance meaning (and its mood) through sound effects,
      voice, and music.

      * Abby was skeptical about multimodal composition because it didn’t seem
      like “real” writing to her. Click here to \[read/view/listen to] Abby’s

        * Block quote (221): “I think that there’s just maybe a little bit too much of a focus on online writing just because—just as someone who’s coming from a science background who was interested in writing, none of the online stuff is relevant. Learning different writing styles and being able to go to a professional and ask them to help you with this specific type of writing that you’re interested in is more important to me than learning how to blog, or to look at an online portfolio, or something like that.”

        * Block quote (225): “I saw that there were a lot of different ways to say something, if that makes sense. It depends who you’re saying it to and why you’re saying it. I realize you have to think—there are a lot more decisions that go into how you want to convey something…. Like how do you want to—do you want it to be in an essay? Like literally words on a page or do you want to turn it into something with pictures or do you want to put it on a website? All of the things that play into that. If it’s just an essay anyone can read it but then if you put pictures with it you’re influencing people to see a certain thing or if you put it on a website then how do people navigate your website and where is the emphasis? There’s so many decisions that go into that.”

      As you may have already noticed, this website uses text, image, audio,
      video, and graphics to attract readers and keep them engaged.

  * Multimodal composition uses multiple resources for expression.

  * Multimodal composition communicates meaning in ways that text-based writing
  cannot.

  audio,and digital tools.
