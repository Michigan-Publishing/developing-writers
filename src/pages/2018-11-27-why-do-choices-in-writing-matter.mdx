      Written text does not reach every reader in the same way, and not all
      readers are adept at engaging with only text. When writers make choices to
      include other modes in their compositions, they are considering different
      ways that they might reach different readers—after all, good writing
      reaches as many readers as possible.

      Text may be enough to get a message across to readers, but other resources
      to help readers better understand specific points. When writers make
      choices to include features like tables and images, they consider what
      parts of their writing might benefit from different or additional
      representations. Good writers know when to keep things simple and when add
      layers of meaning to their text.
    title: Because sometimes writers need to enhance their writing.

      Sometimes it’s hard to communicate emotion when using just text. Adding a
      multimodal element can help express feelings and appeal to the emotions of
      an audience. As Kaitlin says, ARTIFACT REQUEST link to Kaitlin’s interview

      Some writing—whether in text, email, or in a paper—makes it difficult to
      decipher tone. Adding a multimodal component—like a hyperlink, emoji,
      video, or sound clip—can help convey tone and purpose to an audience.
    title: Because sometimes writers want to be explicit with tone in their writing.

      Writing with all the available means—text, photographs, emoji, figures,
      memes, gifs, video clips, audio clips—is a fun way to communicate a
      message to an audience.
    title: Because it’s fun!

      Writing in the 21st century with the new technology this era affords
      allows writers different ways to write. Why not use them all?! Check out
      what Kaitlin says about it:  ARTIFACT REQUEST [Naomi’s
      chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.21): “Comparing
      traditional writing and new media writing is to me the difference between
      a printed set of papers and a piece that lives on the web. What made me
      start to accept new media was its gift of using hyperlinks to forever
      banish the  bibliography to the seventh circle of literary hell. Even
      better, hyperlinks give you the power to seamlessly provide research and
      evidence for a point with nothing more than the click of a mouse. With new
      media you also suddenly have the ability to illustrate writing with
      pictures and graphics that there previously was never room for. And with
      new media, pieces truly do live. On the web, you don’t just publish
      something; rather you have the capability to keep going back and editing
      what you’ve already put out there” (238).
    title: Because we can!

  Writers can make choices in writing because they have the available means,
  it’s fun to do, and the choices can help them better communicate a message to
  an audience.

Choices in writing matter because judicious choices reach audiences in different ways.
