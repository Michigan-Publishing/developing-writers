      Writing in the digital age is—as it has always been—about making choices:
      What tools are available? What will be most effective with this audience?
      Consider Kaitlin, a student featured in [Chapter
      8](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.13).


      When she starts her [gateway
      portfolio](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.19), she
      builds a website that is identical in form to print, but that is
      distributed electronically. Author Naomi writes:

      Kaitlin eventually learns digital writing skills and develops rhetorical
      awareness (an awareness of the relationship between what she’s writing,
      for whom, and how she’s writing it). In explaining differences between her
      traditional writing and multimodal composition she talks about what
      multimodality enables her to do, including developing a new vision of her
      audience and what they’d like to see:

      Kaitlin recognizes that print and digital are different spaces that
      require different ways to present her material. She makes choices that
      attend to her audience and purpose in the digital space, and she explains
      her selections. Her ability to do make and explain her choices indicates
      that she is developing as a writer.


      **FOR INSTRUCTORS:** teaching multimodal writing


      Kaitlin describes the role of considering the relationship between content
      and form in a way that was different from what she had learned in her
      other classes:

    title: Case Study
  - point: >-
      When writers are able to make choices in what they say and how they say
      it, they start to see themselves as developing writers. In Chapter 8,
      Silver explains:

      One caveat: even if students could talk about their choices, they weren’t
      necessarily reflected in their portfolios and vice versa. Development is
      uneven.
    title: Writing multimodally and becoming “a writer”
afterPoints: >-
  Writing in the digital age uses all available means—text, image, video, sound,
  and digital tools—to communicate more effectively and purposefully than “words
  on a page” alone. The thoughtful selection of multimodal elements can enhance
  the effectiveness of a message to an audience
---
In our study, we learned the digital age offers more available, accessible, and universal ways of communicating to reach audiences in purposeful ways.
