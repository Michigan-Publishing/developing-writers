      Meeting the needs and expectations of audiences gives writing more impact,
      but sometimes it is difficult to know what audiences expect.


      **FOR INSTRUCTORS**: Student writers will face many choices in engaging
      with their audiences. 


      [In thinking about their audiences, some students might shift between
      different kinds of academic and non-academic
      writing.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.25) 


      For example, as [Lizzie Hutton and Gail Gibson
      found](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.25), "students who
      align their writing development with the 'academic' tend to see writing as
      constituting the communication of thought" (90).


      In other words, some students prefer to write in ways that match the
      writing of a particular style or discipline (e.g., science).


      On the other hand, "students who talked about their growth as writers as
      more closely tied to the 'creative' tend to understand writing instead as
      constituting the generation of thought" (90). 


      In this case, some students prefer to write in a way that creates new
      ideas.


      Using different kinds of writing helps us reach audiences in different
      ways.


      As [Ryan McCarty’s chapter shows, students’ experiences and perspectives
      of their roles as writers and their writing influence the way they see
      their audiences](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.30). 


      >[I think more of a development, because it was a different form of
      writing. It also helped me reflect upon the way we write in science.
      Between the two, it showed me how I can communicate effectively when we do
      talk about—okay, so you’re talking to more of a lay audience as opposed to
      the scientific community in communicating your research. Let’s look at
      different ways to read and
      write.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.30)

      ## Writing for others can mean making communication accessible to as many
      readers as possible.

      > I am seeing a lot of upcoming writers or a lot of upcoming students,
      because they’re interacting with me on Twitter on an everyday basis or on
      Facebook… Social media—I like to think of it as talking from a position of
      power. You can say, ‘Why don’t you look at…
    title: Are we writing to or for audiences?
  - point: >-
      Reaching audiences can depend a lot on kinds of writing and purpose.


      ## One challenge is knowing which kinds of writing are appropriate for the
      audiences being addressed.


      [Consider Kris, who finds the language of science to be a necessary step
      in her development as a
      writer.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.29)


      > At first when I was starting to read papers, I thought scientists used
      unnecessarily large words to describe things. Then what I found as I
      started writing was that we have a specific vocabulary, just like any
      field does, and it’s just way easier to communicate in that way. You can
      use one word to describe what would have to be used as a whole sentence.


      ## Another challenge is making sure purposes for writing are clear to
      audiences.


      [Consider Kaitlin, who explores how her multimodal purposes affect how her
      audiences think about
      traveling.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.35)


      > I would pick out quotes where it was making the point that I wanted, but
      over an image, so you’re not just immediately assaulted with a ton of
      text. You have  to  scroll  over  it  to  see  it… ‘Why do people
      adventure, and what do they know that I don’t?’


      And so, we make our writing matter for our audiences by making choices
      about style and delivery.

In our study, we learned that we think about the needs and expectations of our readers by making decisions about the kind, the direction, and the purpose of our writing.
