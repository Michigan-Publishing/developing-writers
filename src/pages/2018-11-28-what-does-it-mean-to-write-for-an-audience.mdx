      Most writing aims to share our ideas with others. This is like being in a
      conversation: how we communicate often depends a good deal on who is on
      the receiving end. In other words, audience matters.


      In thinking about audience, we consider two closely related ideas: who the
      audience is, and how we talk to them. Let’s unpack these two ideas.
    title: Writing for an audience
  - point: >-
      Audience is a flexible concept. The audience might be a specific person.
      The audience might be a group of people who share an interest, and
      therefore share some common knowledge. The audience might be relatively
      unknown except for very general characteristics.


      Audiences that share an interest and common knowledge often have
      specialized ways of expressing ideas. Such groups, which writing
      instructors sometimes refer to as **discourse communities**, could include
      physicians, video game enthusiasts, teachers, skateboarders, K-pop fans,
      or physicists. Writers need to be aware of what specialized audiences
      expect.


      But even when we aren’t sure who our audience is, we can imagine them (or
      ask for feedback from peers) to help us understand how our writing is
      interpreted.


      In either case, thinking about audiences makes it easier to communicate
      effectively with them. Thinking about what an audience knows and cares
      about makes it easier to appeal to their understanding and concerns.

    title: Who is the audience?
  - point: >-
      There are many ways to write [to or
      for](/pages/writing-is-social/how-is-writing-a-social-activity/how-do-writers-respond-to-audience-expectations/#are-we-writing-to-or-for-audiences)
      an audience. Teacher audiences often expect essays, lab reports, math
      problems, stories, or poems. Employer audiences may expect memos, patient
      reports, sales projections, résumés, or cover letters. Familiar audiences
      may expect emails, texts, posts, replies, and other informal writing.


      Writing addressed to different audiences requires varying features of
      organization, structure, and formality of language. These features of
      writing matter because they address **expectations** that audiences may
      have. Good writers understand which expectations are most relevant for the
      audience they want to address.

    title: How do we talk to an audience?
afterPoints: >-
  In order to communicate most effectively, writers need to think about their
  audiences and what they might expect.

In our study, we learned that thinking about the reader is an essential part of writing; in order to reach them, we need to know who they are and what they expect.
