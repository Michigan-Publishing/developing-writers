      * Most writing aims to share our ideas with others. This is like being in
      a conversation: how we communicate often depends a good deal on who is on
      the receiving end. In other words, audience matters.

      * In thinking about audience, we consider two closely related ideas: who
      the audience is, and how we talk to them. Let’s unpack these two ideas.
    title: Writing for an audience
  - point: >-
      * Audience is a flexible concept. The audience might be a specific person.
      The audience might be a group of people who share an interest, and
      therefore share some common knowledge. The audience might be relatively
      unknown except for very general characteristics.
        * Audiences that share an interest and common knowledge often have specialized ways of expressing ideas. Such groups, which writing instructors sometimes refer to as **discourse communities**, could include physicians, video game enthusiasts, teachers, skateboarders, K-pop fans, or physicists. Writers need to be aware of what specialized audiences expect.
        * But even when we aren’t sure who our audience is, we can imagine them (or ask for feedback from peers) to help us understand how our writing is interpreted.
      * In either case, thinking about audiences makes it easier to communicate
      effectively with them. Thinking about what an audience knows and cares
      about makes it easier to appeal to their understanding and concerns.

    title: Who is the audience?
  - point: >-
      * There are many ways to write [to or
      for](/pages/writing-is-social/how-is-writing-a-social-activity/what-does-it-mean-to-write-for-an-audience/)
      an audience. Teacher audiences often expect essays, lab reports, math
      problems, stories, or poems. Employer audiences may expect memos, patient
      reports, sales projections, résumés, or cover letters. Familiar audiences
      may expect emails, texts, posts, replies, and other informal writing.

      * This word cloud represents some of the most common everyday writing that
      people do

      * Writing addressed to different audiences requires varying features of
      organization, structure, and formality of language.

      * Each of the following addresses a different audience and uses different
      features:
        * A lab report
        * A love letter
        * A five-paragraph essay
        * A résumé
        * Chat-room rules
      * Features of writing matter because they address expectations that
      audiences may have. Good writers remain aware of the conventional
      approaches that are relevant for the audience we want to address.

        * > I think just, yeah, being able to shape my ideas independently—that’s really how they affected me. As far as, as I practiced and as I became more confident as a writer, I was also becoming more independent, especially in the ideas, where I’m not afraid to take a different stance than a professor, and say, “Hey, maybe you are wrong in this.” I’m not gonna change  your  opinion,  but,  hey,  let’s  pretend that  you  would  for  a  second. That independence has really helped"
        * Having different approaches at our disposal can make us more independent writers.
    title: How do we talk to an audience?

  In order to communicate most effectively, writers need to think about their
  audiences and what they might expect.

In our study, we learned that thinking about the reader is an essential part of writing; in order to reach them, we need to know who they are and what they expect.
