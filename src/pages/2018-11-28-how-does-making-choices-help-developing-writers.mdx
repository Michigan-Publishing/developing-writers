      Consider Katie in Chapter 4 and the distinctions she makes between writing
      a press release and the writing she was doing at school:


      :::md-component ExpandableBlockquote
      previewText="%5Ba%5D%20press%20release%20is%20written%20like%20%u2026"

      Author Ryan McCarty explains: 


      :::md-component ExpandableBlockquote
      previewText="The%20emphasis%20on%20a%20broad%20collection%20of%20writing%20experiences%20..."
      fullText="%5BThe%20emphasis%20on%20a%20broad%20collection%20of%20writing%20experiences%20is%20noteworthy%2C%20illustrating%20that%2C%20for%20Katie%2C%20the%20writer%20she%20has%20become%20is%20one%20who%20can%20effectively%20distinguish%20between%20exigencies%20of%20particular%20contexts%2C%20drawing%20on%20the%20appropriate%20resources%20in%20her%20writing%20repertoire.%20%5D%28https%3A//hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.27%29"


      Rather than just writing the same way for different audiences, Katie
      identifies what the audience in each community needs and makes choices
      appropriately.


      Now consider Grace in Chapter 7:

      As author Anna Knutson explains, despite being an honors student and an
      avid reader, Grace hates writing because her school writing does not sound
      like the fiction she reads for fun. 


      ## FOR INSTRUCTORS: helping students make choices


      Students benefit from being taught how to make choices in their writing to
      meet the needs and expectations of their audience. Take another look at
      Grace and how she’s been taught to write:

      Practice in one type of writing can improve that one type, but it doesn’t
      help teach students how to make choices or develop flexibility in writing
      in different ways for different audiences. Check out [How writers respond
      to audience
      expectations](/pages/writing-is-social/how-is-writing-a-social-activity/how-do-writers-respond-to-audience-expectations/)
      for tips for teaching students to make choices in their writing that adapt
      to the varying needs of an audience.
    title: Having choices in writing
  - point: >-
      [As author Naomi Silver explains, it’s about making choices, but it’s
      about reflecting on those choices as well. Naomi describes Sophie, a
      nonminor, who, in her entry interview, articulates why she chooses Prezi
      as her presentation
      medium:](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.33)


      > Prezi sort of allows you to almost communicate your thought process
      through the presentation, because you can zoom. We had this one map that
      we’re showing and then we want to show another map next to it and, rather
      than clicking on the next slide, we just zoom out, and you can see both
      maps next to each other. Which, when you’re watching something, it’s just
      much more visually appealing


      Sophie describes a connection between what appears on two different maps
      and how she envisions their relationship “by presenting the connection
      visually as well as verbally using the Prezi platform’s unique ‘zooming’
      affordances, and she articulates that relationship in her depiction of the
      ‘presentation’ itself as ‘almost communicat\[ing] \[her] thought process.
      Although Sophie falls back on the language of ‘visual appeal’ (similarly
      to Katie) to explain why she prefers the spatial relationship enabled by
      the Prezi platform to a more linear, slide-based presentation platform, it
      seems clear that she has an intentional rhetorical design in mind
      (metacognitive awareness) and is able to choose the appropriate medium ...
      to facilitate it (metacognitive regulation)”


      Sophie makes a choice about why she uses prezi over powerpoint for her
      presentation, and then can explain how prezi makes it the more effective
      presentation platform in this case.


      [Jenna, also in Naomi’s chapter, explains how her writing choices help her
      develop her
      argument:](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.34)


      > I saw that there were a lot of different ways to say something, if that
      makes sense. It depends who you’re saying it to and why you’re saying it.
      I realize you have to think—there are a lot more decisions that go into
      how you want to convey something....Like how do you want to—do you want it
      to be in an essay? Like literally words on a page or do you want to turn
      it into something with pictures or do you want to put it on a website? All
      of the things that play into that. If it’s just an essay anyone can read
      it but then if you put pictures with it you’re influencing people to see a
      certain thing or if you put it on a website then how do people navigate
      your website and where is the emphasis? There’s so many decisions that go
      into that


      Jenna doesn’t make choices just because she knows she should, she reflects
      on which choices would be best to help develop and support her argument.


      ## For Instructors: helping students reflect on the choices they make


      When students work on and submit writing assignments, consider having them
      submit a reflection that explains the variety of choices they made in
      their composition.


      Students can answer questions like, what audience are they writing to and
      what writing choices have they made to develop their argument for this
      audience? What kinds of expectations will their audience have about how
      their work is written? Will they be looking for particular formatting or
      organizational choices, for instance? What kind of evidence would appeal
      to this audience?


      These conversations can occur at any stage of the writing process.
    title: Making choices and reflecting on them
  - point: >-
      Students considered themselves writers when they could draw on their range
      of writing resources, make decisions about which resources to use, and
      reflect on those choices. [Author Anne Gere highlights students who talk
      about this process:](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.36)


      > For example, in talking about a writing course, Joy commented on
      learning ‘about the ethics in writing and how to be a more credible
      writer. Those are skills that I can carry over to magazine journalism....I
      would definitely take what I’ve learned  in  this  class  and  apply  it 
      to  making  videos  for ‘Her  Campus,’  a  nationally circulated online
      magazine. Sophia talked about using reflection outside of the academy: ‘I
      had to apply, over the summer, for that job. It was a lot about reflecting
      on past experiences in terms of leadership, and working in teams and stuff
      like that. That kind of forced me to think about all the experience I’d
      had up until that point and flesh them out into a way that made me seem
      desirable as a candidate.’ Because she had learned how to reflect on her
      writing, Sophie was able to transfer that capacity  to  writing  a  job 
      application.  In  addition  to  transferring  learning  from  one context
      to another, the repertoires students claimed gave them rhetorical
      flexibility: ‘My style changes based off of what type of paper it is,’
      said Jack. Jonah claimed, ‘I think that \[reflection] eventually will
      translate into, will help me in a job in the future, just being able to
      adapt and learn different ways of writing....I’m probably not  going  to 
      be  writing  research  papers  or  essays  about  stuff,  but  I  think 
      it  does translate into other ways of working.’ This capacity for using
      reflection to identify one’s  own  writerly  abilities  and  to figure 
      out  how  to  use  them  in  new  situations points to another dimension
      of writing development 


      [This is similar to students’ reflections about making multimodal choices
      and becoming a
      “writer”:](/pages/writing-involves-choices/how-do-we-write-in-the-digital-age/how-do-writers-compose-in-the-digital-age/)

  When writers are given the opportunity to make their own choices to fit the
  needs of their audience, they are more likely to consider themselves writers.

In our study, we learned that when writers can make their own choices to fit the needs of their audience and the expectations of that community, they are more likely to consider themselves effective writers.
