      * Teachers often direct their writing instruction toward the development
      of “expert status in one distinct academic context.” In other words, when
      thinking about what students ought to do, the focus is on learning to
      write like a physicist, or a philosopher, or any number of other
      specialized roles that students have mentioned above. [link to Ryan’s

      * However, as author Ryan McCarty points out, students often want to draw
      on a wider range of writing tools and practices in order to reach their
      chosen audience. They see writing development:
        * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [link to Ryan’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.40)
        * “as a process of learning many genres and practices from a range of disciplines, professions, and extracurricular contexts, often holding these practices up for comparison, with the goal of leveraging all of those knowledges against each other to be more effective across all of the contexts in which they write” (116)

    title: How do students think about academic writing instruction?
  - point: >-
      * So, students don’t want to stick to one discipline when writing—but that
      doesn’t mean that students have no need for <writing instruction in their
      specific communities.> (INTERNAL LINK to Option 2, Main Point 2) In fact,
      McCarty found that most students were only able to think about the
      differences between disciplines after they had learned enough about one
      discipline to understand what sort of differences to look for.

      * And understanding of a specific discipline helps students see, as Kris
      did, that they too can “develop an individual style without straying from
      the conventions of the discipline” (121).

      * Thus, the use of tools like <hedging and boosting> (INTERNAL LINK to
      Option 1, Main Point 3.) becomes an important way both to indicate that a
      student understands what is expected of them, and to further their own
      specific goals as writers.
    title: Why is it important to learn specific academic writing skills?
  - point: >-
      * For Ryan, the most powerful moments are those when a student sees that
      they are able to use the tools from different disciplines in original
      ways. As Kris says, while integrating lessons from physics and philosophy
      into her own work in biology: she needs to “look at different ways to read
      and write.” INTERNAL LINK to [Option 2, Main Point
      3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-1UlV002Iq3f9ulzUwiGQS6m15NDMccAevCZskx-0o/edit#bookmark=id.5odg6jetrbk3)

      * And Jonah helps us see that the tools that we learn to use in academic
      writing can be used in non-academic settings. INTERNAL LINK to [Option,
      Main Point

      * Teachers play an important part in helping students develop the ability
      to reflect on their choices. Let’s hear more from Ryan McCarty as he talks
      about how teachers do this work in the classroom.  
        * First of all, we can help students to talk about the connections they are making, and thus make those connections consciously.

        * And second, pointing out the tools that are used by specific disciplines, especially as students are actually using them in their writing, is important. Students who are taught to notice specific tools like <hedges and boosters> (INTERNAL LINK to Option 1, Main Point 3) will be more likely to use those tools themselves.

    title: What do students need most from writing instructors?
afterPoints: >-
  Teachers can help students most when they develop both specific academic
  writing tools, and an awareness that those tools can be used creatively in
  other academic and non-academic settings.

The two most important things that teachers can give their students are a good set of academic writing tools, and the confidence to choose when and how to use those them.
