      Writers who engage with feedback can have a better understanding of
      audience because they understand that, through writing, they are entering
      into a conversation with their readers. 


      > My project ended up being way in a completely different mode and
      displayed way differently because a girl that was like—she plays the bass,
      she’s in the music school—she’s like, ‘Oh, I’ve done this before and you
      should try this.’ It was very kind of push and shove kind of revision. I
      think my writing and me intellectually as a whole I think was pushed
      forward because of the people and the different array of measures and
      backgrounds I guess.That was really cool.

    title: What can feedback do for us?
  - point: >-
      Receiving feedback provides a way to reflect on the strengths and
      weaknesses of our writing. Giving feedback likewise allows good writers to
      consider different approaches and perspectives about writing.
    title: Can feedback (really) make better writers?
  - point: >-
      Getting feedback from different perspectives can help us write for
      different audiences.


      > I don’t think in any of my classes I really had any collaborative
      projects, but peer reviews have been so extremely helpful. You get a lot
      from your professor ‘cause obviously they’re professional teachers in
      writing and stuff, but there’s nothing quite like the feedback that people
      who are in the same situation as you have. \[Peer review] was insanely
      valuable for learning how to frame it ways that we as students wanted to
      frame it.

    title: One consideration for feedback
  - point: >-
      Consider what feedback can offer. Experts (such as teachers) or audience
      members (such as classmates or colleagues) can help writers see their work
      differently. 


      > When I came here freshman year, I would frequently receive feedback in
      my classes that my papers needed to be more specific.… Many times my
      [instructors] would circle a sentence and mark in the margin, ‘this could
      be its own paragraph,’ or ‘develop this idea, what do you mean?’ I was
      taking complex arguments or ideas and not giving them the amount of space
      they deserved to be explained fully.… It took practice and a lot of red
      writing in the margins, but I started to get a hang of this specificity in
      my academic writing.

    title: 'So, how to make feedback work?'
  - point: >-
      Peer review can help us improve as writers because receiving suggestions
      from others as well as reading and responding to what others have written
      can improve the ability to see problems in one’s writing.

      > Okay. Yeah, so the class was structured that you wrote three eight to
      ten page personal essays throughout the semester, and you got workshopped
      once for one of those three essays. It was a lot of personal writing, but
      it was also a lot of reading, peer editing, and coming in and
      workshopping. I really enjoyed that class for that reason. People—the
      first week, no one was really sure. ‘Oh, what are we gonna write about,’
      but people started to write about really real things. It was a very, very
      interesting class to be in, and it made me respect a lot of people that I
      didn’t know to hear about what they were going through and what they were
      writing about. I think [instructor] did a really good job of creating a
      space where we could all talk about things like that. I think he did a
      good job structuring the peer editing sessions where they were
      constructive and they weren’t everyone was saying, ‘Oh, great job.’ You
      got honest feedback, but it was a safe space where people were also
      telling you what they liked, and you felt okay bringing big ideas to the
      table….I think I learned a lot, like I said, from having to write those
      there essays and realizing that people didn’t know me as well as people
      from home did, so I had to be more specific about my background for my
      personal pieces to make sense. Then, also, I learned a lot from reading
      other people’s pieces and the styles and the choices that they made, so it
      was a great class. I really liked it. Probably one of my favorites at U of
      M.

afterPoints: >-
  Feedback is most helpful when writers engage critically with it, whether it
  comes from an expert or a peer, and use it to help reach their own writing
  goals.

Feedback can provide us with different insights and perspectives about our own writing, which can help us learn what our audiences need from us.
