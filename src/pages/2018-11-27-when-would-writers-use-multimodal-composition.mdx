      Most people are already doing multimodal composition. In fact, most of us
      are doing it all the time: when we text, when we share photos or videos,
      when we ❤️ somebody else’s photos or videos. 


      * But ❤️ isn’t always effective. Usually it doesn’t work in a résumé, a
      business letter, or a research paper. So, given the range of multimodal
      choices available: when might writers use them?

      * ARTIFACT REQUEST: Screenshots from essays with graphs or tables; from
      the portfolios or websites with audio or video links; perhaps GIFs of
      websites with videos? I am wondering whether we could take screenshots of
      different multimodal elements and turn them into a short video with
      narration about how multimodal composition can help tell a story?

    title: When do we use multimodal composition?
  - point: >-
      There are some guidelines we can use for multimodal composition. First,
      who is the audience and what is the composing situation? For instance, a
      photograph of you and your friends at the pool might seem out of place
      when writing to a prospective employer, but might be perfect for your
      followers on Instagram. 


      * Sometimes the situation isn’t so clear. A popular meme might be the best
      way to make a point in a classroom presentation or it might not. 

      * ARTIFACT REQUEST: Transcript or audio (or maybe a screenshot from an
      eportfolio?) concerning a decision to use multimodal elements based on
      audience identity. [Link to Sophie’s entry interview
      transcript](https://umich.app.box.com/file/294316983380) (the audio file
      is not available)
        * Sophie explains the usefulness of Prezi for persuading an audience: “I think it's \[Prezi’s] really fun, but it looks so visually appealing and for a class where you're trying to persuade people of something, that's half the battle is just getting them to look at what you're trying to say. So, yeah, there hasn't really been that much writing necessarily, that's gone into that class, it's more just been—well actually, we're one of the first groups to go. The presentations span over like the course of a month, and we're the first day, so we haven't had that much time to prepare, but it's been really interesting and I think that the Prezi definitely is going to add something… 
        * We had this one map that we're showing and then we want to show another map next to it and, rather than clicking on the next slide, we just zoom out, and you can see both maps next to each other. Which, when you're watching something, it's just much more visually appealing. Not to say that PowerPoint doesn't get the job done, because it does if you just want words on a screen, it's more than okay.” [Link to Naomi’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.13)

      Second, writers need to know which multimodal choices are available. For
      instance, graphs or charts, drawings or photos, audio video, or
      infographics. In this situation, a student wanted to discuss a piece of
      popular music, and had to choose the best way to make her case.


      * ARTIFACT REQUEST: Transcript or audio from Dana, page 225-226,
      concerning development of an audio essay on Kanye West. Link to Dana’s
      entry interview transcript, [Link to Naomi’s
      chapter](https://umich.app.box.com/file/294318997994)
        * I chose a piece that I wrote for \[English course] on the \[Rapper] Song. It was an essay that I wrote an actual song. I thought that I wasted a lot of time in the essay explaining how the music sounded or what the lyrics said. I made an audio essay of it, with me reading it and then it cut into the actual music. That was something that couldn’t have been done without new media. (7)

      Writers should be sure to 


      * Avoid using multimodal elements as decoration

      * Clarify the relationship between multimodal elements and the message the
      piece tries to deliver

      * Consider how multimodal elements can deliver substance.

      * ARTIFACT REQUEST: Transcript or audio concerning the decision to use a
      multimodal element rather than written text. Perhaps from Lauren on page
      226? [Link to Lauren’s entry interview

        * “It’s cool because I can express myself in a medium other than words, but I can still express the same ideas that I’m writing about. I mean, I’m like—for my SAC \[Screen Arts and Culture] 290 class, we are doing black and white 16mm silent film, so it’s really cool cause we had like somebody playing chess—two guys playing chess—and it looked really, really gorgeous. It was like, “I could write about this, but it’s so much cooler to see it in this medium,” and the way I choose to cut the angles, and where I’m cutting for continuity, and stuff like that, that is kind of like writing in itself.” (8)
      * FOR INSTRUCTORS: Teachers who want multimodal composition need to invite
      it into their classrooms and assignments. For instance, specifying MLA or
      APA format and 12-point type, double-spaced does not encourage students to
      include maps, tables, graphs, or photos that could improve the text.
    title: What limitations are there to multimodal composition?

  Multimodal composition means thinking about using a variety of tools to
  deliver messages effectively to an intended audience.

Multimodal composition means thinking about ways to use images, sounds, video and other means to deliver messages most effectively.
