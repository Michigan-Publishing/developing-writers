      We recently asked people about popular conceptions of writing. Respondents
      indicated that they participate in feedback with a variety of people,
      mostly INFOGRAPHIC: a word cloud that indicates with whom.


      Feedback works well when we have the opportunity to receive it from people
      who we believe are authorized to give it to us. In school, this is most
      often from our instructors. Sometimes we are asked to give and receive
      feedback from peers. And sometimes we seek it out on our own. Sometimes we
      hesitate to seek feedback from our peers, but they can be the exact
      audience we’re targeting. Check out what Joy says about it: ARTIFACT
      REQUEST: Link to Ben’s chapter: p. 70 “Another student, Joy positioned
      peer review … more authorized than her instructor’s feedback” Link to
      separate pdf of quote.


      **FOR INSTRUCTORS: equal opportunity to feedback**


      * It is important to keep in mind that not all students have equal access
      to people they know and feel like are authorized to offer them feedback on
      their writing, as excerpts from Chapter 9 show. 


      **ARTIFACT REQUEST: Link to Sarah’s chapter.**


      * Map in Sarah’s chapter (p. 261) and Sarah’s prose (p. 259-261 “NC data,
      as pictured … value of academic writing.” Link to separate PDF of quote.

      * Just because students are all at the same school or university does not
      mean their experiences with feedback will be the same. 


      **ARTIFACT REQUEST: Swofford’s Appendix 9 lists the characteristics of
      each Neighborhood Cluster to offer a sense of the students from each
      cluster.**


      **FOR INSTRUCTORS: developing rapport with students**


      * Developing a rapport with students also increases the likelihood that
      they will want to critically engage with the feedback they receive from
      their instructors.


      **ARTIFACT REQUEST: Link to full transcript. Link to audio file. (Clip
      starts at 1:04:22) Quote from exit interview with Sidney: “I think
      \[instructor] did a really good job of creating a space where we could all
      talk about things like that. I think he did a good job structuring the
      peer editing sessions where they were constructive and they weren’t
      everyone was saying, “Oh, great job.” You got honest feedback, but it was
      a safe space where people were also telling you what they liked, and you
      felt okay bringing big ideas to the table. I wrote about struggling with
      depression, which I was just—that’s something that I don’t talk about with
      anyone, but I was impressed that \[instructor] was able to make a space
      that I felt comfortable doing that with 20 strangers.”**
    title: From whom do we solicit feedback?

Feedback works when writers are able to critically engage with the feedback they receive and make choices that support their purposes for writing.
