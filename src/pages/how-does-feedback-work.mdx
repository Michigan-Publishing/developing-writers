      We recently asked people about popular conceptions of writing. Respondents
      indicated that they participate in feedback with a variety of people,
      mostly INFOGRAPHIC: a word cloud that indicates with whom.


      Feedback works well when we have the opportunity to receive it from people
      who we believe are authorized to give it to us. In school, this is most
      often from our instructors. Sometimes we are asked to give and receive
      feedback from peers. And sometimes we seek it out on our own. Sometimes we
      hesitate to seek feedback from our peers, but they can be the exact
      audience we’re targeting. Check out what Joy says about it: ARTIFACT
      REQUEST: [Link to Ben’s
      chapter](https://umich.box.com/s/wwvk6ktnxdwux6fw98jede9ygwjjsrgg): p. 70
      “Another student, Joy positioned peer review … more authorized than her
      instructor’s feedback” [Link to separate pdf of
      quote](https://umich.app.box.com/file/312469758233).


      ## **FOR INSTRUCTORS: equal opportunity to feedback**


      * It is important to keep in mind that not all students have equal access
      to people they know and feel like are authorized to offer them feedback on
      their writing, as excerpts from Chapter 9 show. 

      * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [Link to Sarah’s

        * Map in Sarah’s chapter (p. 261) and Sarah’s prose (p. 259-261 “NC data, as pictured … value of academic writing.” [Link to separate PDF of quote](https://umich.app.box.com/file/312469841656).
        * Just because students are all at the same school or university does not mean their experiences with feedback will be the same. 
      * ARTIFACT REQUEST: Swofford’s [Appendix
      9](https://umich.box.com/s/os4qs2x7dn0fts0wnvzx91uf8806ah6e) lists the
      characteristics of each Neighborhood Cluster to offer a sense of the
      students from each cluster.


      ## **FOR INSTRUCTORS: developing rapport with students**


      * Developing a rapport with students also increases the likelihood that
      they will want to critically engage with the feedback they receive from
      their instructors.

      file.](https://umich.app.box.com/file/249985523090) (Clip starts at
      1:04:22) Quote from exit interview with Sidney: “I think \[instructor] did
      a really good job of creating a space where we could all talk about things
      like that. I think he did a good job structuring the peer editing sessions
      where they were constructive and they weren’t everyone was saying, “Oh,
      great job.” You got honest feedback, but it was a safe space where people
      were also telling you what they liked, and you felt okay bringing big
      ideas to the table. I wrote about struggling with depression, which I was
      just—that’s something that I don’t talk about with anyone, but I was
      impressed that \[instructor] was able to make a space that I felt
      comfortable doing that with 20 strangers.”
    title: From whom do we solicit feedback?
  - point: >-
      It’s not necessarily about where we get feedback, but what we do with the
      feedback we receive. Feedback has a higher likelihood of working when we
      critically engage with it, asking ourselves questions about how the
      suggestions help us to achieve the purposes we want in our writing. Check
      out this matrix to see what critical engagement can look like.


      ## **FOR INSTRUCTORS: feedback as conversation**


      * Creating a relationship with students where the process of feedback can
      become more of a conversation rather than directives can also increase the
      likelihood that students critically engage with feedback. Check out what
      Joy explains her instructor did: **ARTIFACT REQUEST: **[**Link to Emily
      and Justine's
      chapter**](https://umich.box.com/s/qet25zo82di0jzdxgroog5p4dm0tmpkb)**: p.

      writer”**

      ## FOR INSTRUCTORS: student engagement with feedback


      * How are our students engaging with the feedback we offer? Are they doing
      everything we recommend, nothing at all, or something in between?
      Encourage students to critically analyze feedback the way they analyze
      other texts to figure out what works best for their writing.

      * VIDEO INTERVIEW with Emily and Justine discussing the pedagogical
      implications of their chapter

      * VIDEO INTERVIEW: with Ben to have him explain how peer review improves
      student writing.


      ## FOR INSTRUCTORS: peer review


      * Consider having students peer review each other’s work at different
      stages in the writing process, having them write to each other about
      what’s working (and why) and what’s confusing (and why). Allow students to
      talk out with each other how their work is going. This lesson plan may
      also help teach students more about peer review and how to make it work
      for them: REQUEST FOR AUTHORS: lesson plan on how to teach students how to
      peer review—can this include how to teach students to respect each others’
      voices?

      * Easing into Peer Review in your class
        * If you sense that students don’t feel authorized to give each other feedback, have them play the “what if” game. After reading a classmate’s essay they ask what would happen if …? For example, what if you changed the title? What if you moved this sentence to the beginning of the paragraph instead of the end?
        * Another activity to help get students into peer review is the eliminate 100 game: ask students to eliminate 100 words from their own or a classmate’s writing. 
      * Make sure students are aware of the purpose of peer review as well.
      ARTIFACT REQUEST: I think this is from Ben’s chapter (page numbers are
      updated to reflect the most recent copy): [Link to Ben’s
      chapter:](https://umich.box.com/s/wwvk6ktnxdwux6fw98jede9ygwjjsrgg) “A
      clear finding, then, is that when students report that the purpose of peer
      review is unclear to them, they are likely to fall back on dominant
      ideologies not only around grammatical correctness, but also, as I argue,
      around a transactional view of writing expertise that privileges
      instructor authority over student authority, undermining the stated goals
      of peer review” (8-9). Peer review is most effective when students know
      the purpose and have clear goals, like specific questions to respond to in
      their peer’s writing. Three questions that often elicit generative
      feedback are: What’s working for you in what I’ve writing? Why is it
      working? What are moments where you’re confused or have questions?

      * To help students engage with the purpose of peer review, try this
      reading to explain a goal of writing workshop: EXTERNAL LINK: to [Jeremiah

      you”](http://www.glimmertrain.com/bulletins/essays/b27chamberlin.php)

      What type of feedback works? And what do students do with the feedback we
      offer?

      * ARTIFACT REQUEST: We need a audio, video, and/or transcript segment that
      shows where Dan is learning to trust feedback. [Link to full interview
      transcript.](https://umich.app.box.com/file/294322294666) [Link to audio
      file.](https://umich.app.box.com/file/249984946803) [Link to Dan’s
      video.](https://umich.app.box.com/file/293261685442) 

      * “Writing became synonymous with opinions, and it only takes a few bad
      opinions to shake my confidence.”

      * Dan’s attitude, which he brought with him to the University of Michigan,
      is a common one amongst first years in college. He wasn’t sure who to
      trust when getting feedback on his writing from his classmates. He knew
      that asking other people for their opinion mattered, but too often the
      feedback focused on something he wasn’t interested in, or focused on what
      was “wrong” with his writing, not what was right. It made it hard for him
      to buy into the peer response exercises in his first-year writing course.

      * He also made it clear that he wanted to be in control of his writing
      experience: “No one gets to determine my writing process except myself.” 

      * For Dan, asking others for input represented a loss of control, and a
      potential rebuke of the effort he put into his writing. Even after four
      years of college, Dan had moved only a little: “I’d rather go to the
      instructor for feedback... I didn’t always take away a ton from peer
      review.”

      * But his instructors pushed him, nonetheless. They let him know that his
      classmates would be the ultimate source of feedback for him. That wasn’t
      easy for him. Dan often found that the feedback he got wasn’t about the
      questions he had. 

      * But when he had to put his work on the Internet, in classes and as a
      student journalist, he had to open himself to the possibility that anyone
      could offer him feedback. And hearing from his audience made him look with
      new eyes at his own writing.

      * And that lesson changed him. He couldn’t see it at the time, but his
      attitude shifted, and he was open to new possibilities in “peer review.”
      After graduating, Dan took a job as the social media specialist for a
      professional sports team. Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat became his job,
      and the feedback rolled in. But Dan admits that “because I had that
      experience opening myself up to feedback, I’m ready to handle it today.”
      And what was once feedback has become collaboration for him: “when you
      jump into social media you have to be willing to collaborate with anyone
      and everyone.”

      * “College as a whole is critical for collaboration... the more voices you
      have giving you feedback, the more you learn”

      student who started as uncritically resistant to feedback and who became
      critically engaged with it.

Feedback works when writers are able to critically engage with the feedback they receive and make choices that support their purposes for writing.
