      Feedback works well when it comes from people authorized to give it. [In
      school, this usually means our instructors. Sometimes writers give and
      receive feedback from peers. And sometimes they seek it out on their
      own.](/pages/writing-is-social/how-does-feedback-from-others-help-us-get-better-at-writing/what-is-feedback/#where-do-people-go-for-feedback)
      Sometimes we hesitate to seek feedback from our peers, but they can be the
      exact audience we’re targeting. Check out what Joy says about it:

      **FOR INSTRUCTORS:** equal opportunity to feedback


      Not all students have equal access to people who can offer them
      authoritative feedback on their writing, as excerpts from Chapter 9 show.

      **FOR INSTRUCTORS:** developing rapport with students


      Developing rapport with students increases the likelihood that they will
      want to critically engage with the feedback they receive.

    title: From whom do we solicit feedback?
  - point: >-
      Feedback has a higher likelihood of working when writers critically engage
      with it, asking questions about how the suggestions help to achieve
      purposes for writing. Check out this matrix to see what critical
      engagement can look like.


      ## FOR INSTRUCTORS: feedback as conversation


      Making the process of giving feedback more of a conversation rather than
      directives can increase the likelihood that students critically engage
      with it. Check out what Joy explains her instructor did:

      ## FOR INSTRUCTORS: student engagement with feedback


      How are students engaging with the feedback offered? Are they doing
      everything recommended, nothing at all, or something in between? Encourage
      students to critically analyze feedback the way they analyze other texts.


      ## FOR INSTRUCTORS: peer review


      Consider having students peer review each other’s work at different stages
      in the writing process. Ask them to write to each other about what’s
      working (and why) and what’s confusing (and why). Allow students to talk
      with each other about how their work is going.

      Peer review is most effective when students know the purpose and have
      clear goals, like specific questions to respond to in their peer’s
      writing. Three questions that often elicit generative feedback are: What’s
      working for you in the writing? Why is it working? What are moments where
      you’re confused or have questions?


      [This lesson plan](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.286) from Ben
      (chapter 2) can help teachers and students learn about and engage with
      peer review.


      [This lesson plan](https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10079890.cmp.285) from Ben
      (chapter 2) provides directions for in-class face-to-face peer review.


      Easing into Peer Review in your class


      If you sense that students don’t feel authorized to give each other
      feedback, have them play the “what if” game. After reading a classmate’s
      essay they ask what would happen if …? For example, what if you changed
      the title? What if you moved this sentence to the beginning of the
      paragraph instead of the end?


      Another activity to help get students into peer review is the eliminate
      100 game: ask students to eliminate 100 words from their own or a
      classmate’s writing.


      To help students engage with the purpose of peer review, try this reading
      to explain a goal of writing workshop: [Jeremiah Chamberlain’s “Workshop
      is not for
      you”](http://www.glimmertrain.com/bulletins/essays/b27chamberlin.php)
