      [Author Anne Gere explains that feedback means showing other people our
      writing and thinking about what we can learn from their comments. When we
      engage with others’ feedback, we become aware of how different audiences
      can understand our
      writing.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.1)

      It’s important to reach out to peers as well as to instructors, or those
      who are more knowledgeable, for feedback. As discussed in Chapter 2,

      Peers can offer feedback in ways that are truly collaborative. Writers who
      consistently show their work only to those who grade or evaluate their
      writing, [may want to find a peer](#what-is-school-sponsored-feedback).

      Peers in both school-sponsored and self-sponsored settings can provide
      useful feedback. Writing centers offer another way to get feedback.
      Writers can improve the quality of feedback by explaining where they need
      help.

      **Critical Engagement:** Where feedback comes from doesn’t matter as much
      as how the writer uses it:

      We would love to know what feedback means to you. When you have entered
      your answers, select “Submit” to see how everyone else thinks about
      feedback.
    title: Do you feedback?
  - point: >-
      We recently surveyed people about where they got feedback, and they said
      that…

      :::md-component PieChart


      People who responded to our survey said they reach out to peers,
      instructors, colleagues, editors, mentors, classmates, siblings, parents,
      and friends to read their writing.
    title: Where do people go for feedback?
afterPoints: >-
  We can engage in feedback in a variety of situations and with a variety of
  people, such as instructors, fellow students, and other people we trust.

In our study, we learned that feedback helps writers improve, whether it comes from an instructor, a peer, or a trusted friend.
