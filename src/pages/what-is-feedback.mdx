      SNIPPET TO THIS [School-sponsored feedback is “peer review \[that is]
      required by an institutional authority figure” (p.
      94).](https://umich.box.com/s/wwvk6ktnxdwux6fw98jede9ygwjjsrgg)

      It’s important to reach out to peers as well as to instructors, or those
      who are more knowledgeable. As discussed in Chapter 2, \[[A] connection
      emerged between authenticity](http://www.google.com). Peers can see our
      writing and offer feedback in ways that are truly collaborative. If we
      find ourselves consistently showing our work only to those who grade or
      evaluate our writing, it may be time to find a peer. <INTERNAL LINK to
      Option 2>


      Click on the box below to \[read/listen/view] Charlotte’s perspective on
      self-sponsored feedback: (see page 105): “Well, I do use peer editing as a
      huge thing … I don’t really enjoy using peer editing in class … I like
      using people who I know I can trust as far as peer editing, which usually
      happens to be my mom a lot, or my friends that work at the Daily or past
      teachers.” Link to full transcript. (Sorry, no audio file available.) 


      Listening to our classmates or colleagues is an altogether different
      experience. Sometimes, we turn to trusted friends because we know that
      they can help us with specific writing skills. But, we can turn to our
      friends for another reason: because they can help us understand how an
      audience reads our work. Feedback of this sort often has more to do with
      writing issues like tone and mood, rather than the questions of structure
      or grammar that writing instructors help us with.


      Consider people in the community, or at work, or at school who can help
      too. At school there may also be a writing center that offers resources
      and support for students to come in and get feedback on their work.
      Remember that friends are a valuable source of feedback as well,
      especially if they’re the target audience. <INTERNAL LINK to audience

      Writers look to different kinds of people for feedback. But as you’ll
      learn in the other sections, it’s not where or with whom you receive
      feedback, it’s how you use it. Writers engage with feedback effectively
      when they think about a larger purpose for their writing and the various
      audiences outside the classroom, as well as think through their own
      writing and make informed decisions about their revisions. Whether writers
      receive feedback from teachers, authority figures, or peers, they can use
      feedback in more thoughtful ways. [Link to Emily and Justine’s
      chapter.](https://umich.box.com/s/qet25zo82di0jzdxgroog5p4dm0tmpkb)

      We would love to know what feedback means to you. When you have entered
      your answers, select “Submit” to see how everyone else thinks about
      feedback.


      **Live Poll Placeholder (Description Below)**


      * If we do a live poll, we will want to devise a way in its programming to
      keep track of IP addresses so that respondents do not spam it. A couple of
      options:

      * Option #1: One version of the live poll could ask users to choose from a
      list of possible people with which they participate in feedback (e.g. with
      close friends, with managers, with co-workers, with family members), or
      writing situations for which they feel feedback is necessary (e.g.,
      personal writing, work writing). When users submit their votes, they will
      be able to see the percentages for all votes.

      * Option #2: Another version of the live poll could ask users to answer a
      simple question (e.g., “Who gives you feedback?”). The poll results, then,
      would keep track of the top 10 results at all times, which means that
      users would have a somewhat new experience every time they visited this
      part of the page.
    title: Do you feedback?
  - point: >-
      We recently asked people about popular conceptions of writing. Respondents
      indicated that they participate in feedback in a variety of situations
      with a variety of people. People said that…


      **Infographic: We should create a two-part infographic that shows (1) a
      pie chart or bar graph that indicates the frequency of places (or
      situations) in respondents who talked about feedback seek it, and (2) a
      short list (or a word cloud) that indicates with whom.**


      According to our popular conceptions of writing survey, respondents reach
      out to peers, instructors, colleagues, editors, mentors, classmates,
      siblings, parents, and friends to read their writing. <Link to Infographic
      word cloud in Option 2>. There may be other people we know and trust to
      offer feedback, as well.

  ## Main Takeaways


  We can engage in feedback in a variety of situations and with a variety of
  people, such as instructors, fellow students, and other people we trust.


  **Transition: Need a way for user to transition to other “Option” sections,
  feedback home page, or other content pages.**

Feedback is one of the best ways we can improve as writers, whether it comes from an instructor, a peer, or just someone we trust.
