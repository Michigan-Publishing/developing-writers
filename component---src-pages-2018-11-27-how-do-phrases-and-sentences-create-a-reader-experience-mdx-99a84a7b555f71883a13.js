Users hover over underlined portions of a sample sentence, and then a box will pop up with information about what a particular phrase does to the meaning. \n  * How do phrases position writers? Users hover over underlined portions of a sample sentence (in this case, from a student interview) to read about what a particular phrase does to the meaning. The bottom navigation is the same; however, users can access the interview transcript and/or audio if they want to know more.\n  * Sentence #1: Let’s look at an interview from Kaitlin, an English and communication studies major.

(INTERNAL LINK to Audiences & Expectations Option 1 What does it mean to write for an audience?)\n* Writers often construct phrases and sentences that help them communicate in specific ways for particular political, religious, or academic communities. Common ways of phrasing or constructing sentences reveal some of the rules that govern a community’s communication practices. For example, check out the phrases and sentences Kris constructs in her biology honors thesis.\n  * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [link to Ryan’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.41)\n  * “While ccrM expression is itself tightly controlled by CtrA, the master cell cycle regulator, it regulates many cell cycle genes via methylation status of various promoters, including ctrA and genes encoding cell division proteins, polarity determining proteins, proteins involved in cell shape, division, and DNA replication \\[21].
