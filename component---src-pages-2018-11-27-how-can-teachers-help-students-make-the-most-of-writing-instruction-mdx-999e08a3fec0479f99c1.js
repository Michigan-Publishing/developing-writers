They see writing development:\n  * ARTIFACT REQUEST: [link to Ryan’s chapter](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.40)\n  * “as a process of learning many genres and practices from a range of disciplines, professions, and extracurricular contexts, often holding these practices up for comparison, with the goal of leveraging all of those knowledges against each other to be more effective across all of the contexts in which they write” (116)\n  * To hear more about how students draw from different parts of their educational become writers, from the author, click here.
