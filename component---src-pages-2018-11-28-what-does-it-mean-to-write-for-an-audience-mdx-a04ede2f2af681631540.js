This is like being in a conversation: how we communicate often depends a good deal on who is on the receiving end.

The audience might be a group of people who share an interest, and therefore share some common knowledge. The audience might be relatively unknown except for very general characteristics.\n  * Audiences that share an interest and common knowledge often have specialized ways of expressing ideas. Such groups, which writing instructors sometimes refer to as **discourse communities**, could include physicians, video game enthusiasts, teachers, skateboarders, K-pop fans, or physicists. Writers need to be aware of what specialized audiences expect.\n  * But even when we aren’t sure who our audience is, we can imagine them (or ask for feedback from peers) to help us understand how our writing is interpreted.\n* In either case, thinking about audiences makes it easier to communicate effectively with them. Thinking about what an audience knows and cares about makes it easier to appeal to their understanding and concerns.\n\nFor insight into how students see these benefits, check out [Ryan McCarty's observations about a student named Kris](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.28)",title:"Who is the audience?"},{point:'* There are many ways to write [to or for](/pages/writing-is-social/how-is-writing-a-social-activity/how-do-writers-respond-to-audience-expectations/#are-we-writing-to-or-for-audiences) an audience.

These features of writing matter because they address expectations that audiences may have.
