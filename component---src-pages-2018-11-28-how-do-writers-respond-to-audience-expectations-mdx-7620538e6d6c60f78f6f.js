impact, but sometimes it is difficult to know what audiences expect.\n\n**FOR INSTRUCTORS: Student writers will face many choices in engaging with their audiences.** \n\nIn thinking about their audiences, [some students might shift between different kinds of academic and non-academic writing.](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/fulcrum.10079890/poi.25) \n\nFor example, as Lizzie Hutton and Gail Gibson found, "students who align their writing development with the \'academic\' tend to see writing as constituting the communication of thought" (90).\n\nIn other words, some students prefer to write in ways that match the writing of a particular style or discipline (e.g., science).\n\nOn the other hand, "students who talked about their growth as writers as more closely tied to the \'creative\' tend to understand writing instead as constituting the generation of thought" (90). \n\nIn this case, some students prefer to write in a way that creates new ideas.\n\nUsing different kinds of writing helps us reach audiences in different ways.\n\nAsking students to write about who their audience is and how they are reaching them can help them align their writing with readers they envision.\n\nAs Ryan McCarty’s chapter shows, students’ experiences and perspectives of their roles as writers and their writing influence the way they see their audiences.\n\n:::md-component
